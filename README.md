# Formalist Standard React

## Example

Generate an example form.

```
$ npm run example && open example/index.html
```

## CSS

Assumes you’re using a global `reset` like [Eric Meyer’s 2.0 version](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/).

The CSS in this project is required to be compiled as [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). It makes no opinions about the compilation of your CSS apart from that, so you can configure your build tool of choice as you like.

## Tests

```
$ npm run test
```

Tests are compiled on the fly from `./test` and piped through `tape`.

Note: CSS references are transformed into CSS Modules for testing using `babel-plugin-css-modules-transform` so we can test things properly. The CSS itself isn’t generated — it just disppears into the ether.
